In hopes to contribute to a fight for full encryption of traffic on the internet, I have created this Java program to serve for encrypted communication between multiple parties.

How does it work? 

At the start of a client program a new pair of private / public key is generated on that CLIENT.

Before first message between to parties, public keys are exchanged.

Even the server cannot see "raw/unencrypted" messages.

For more documentation please see files in Documentation folder
